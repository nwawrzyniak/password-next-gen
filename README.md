## Notes for developers
If you want to help develop this application or compile from source code you should clone this repository with the 
command ```git clone https://github.com/nwawrzyniak/pwng.git --recurse-submodules```. If you do not use 
```--recurse-submodules``` you will have to run ```git submodule update --init``` afterwards. It is recommended to use 
[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/de-de/idea/download) to work on this project, as everything is already 
preconfigured for it. If you use any other IDE you may have to specify the source, resource, test and library 
directories and how the artifact is built.
